# AHK Scripts
This is a collection of AutoHotkey scripts written for Ragnarok Online private servers. Most of these scripts are used to 
automate repetitive tasks, in order to reduce the physical burdens on one's wrists, or to handle tedious, low impact activities.

Note that there are some scripts that are not written for Ragnarok Online.

# How to Use
1. Download AutoHotkey from the official website and install it.
2. Choose a script to run, and run it. You will need administrator rights to run most scripts.
